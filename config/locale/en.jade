      materialsInfo: "The revolution that has occurred in recent years in the field of materials science and engineering, manifested by important technological innovations in practically all sectors of human activity, and particularly in computing, telecommunication, transportation and health, has led most universities and institutions to broaden the scope of action in this field.<br/><br/>The development of Materials Engineering has been very strong in the area of nanomaterials, defined as materials consisting of grains or particles with morphological aspects smaller than one tenth of a micrometer in at least one dimension.<br/><br/>The field of activity of the Materials Engineer covers the metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite materials in the characterization aspects of properties, manufacturing processes and applications, as well as the analysis, creation and development of new products.<br/><br/>Alongside the study of materials themselves, understanding the fundamentals of manufacturing processes is essential. The materials are the resources through which the most diverse engineering projects are implemented, in which the Materials Engineer finds a wide field of action. In this way, students of the course acquire theoretical and practical knowledge that emphasize the relationships between microstructure, processing, properties and the consequent performance of the material in service.",

USP arose from the union of the recently created Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras (FFCL) with the existing Escola Politécnica São Paulo, the Escola Superior de Agricultura (Luiz de Queiroz), the Faculdade de Medicina, the Faculdade de Direito and the Faculdade de Farmácia and Odontologia.",

        poliText1: "Escola Politécnica at Universidade de São Paulo (Poli-USP) boasts over a century of history, turning out generations of engineers who have excelled not only in their own personal fields, but also in the political life of the country and the running of corporations and public entities. Founded in 1893, the erstwhile Escola Politécnica de São Paulo was first based in the building named Solar Marquês de Três Rios. Over time, there was a significant rise in the demand for technical professions and an increase in the number of professors and students, resulting in the need to hire certain well-known international names from the field of engineering. This also led to the expansion of the School's facilities and the construction of the Paula Souza building, concluded in 1899, which also housed the research laboratories and educational workshops. Escola Politécnica became a part of USP in 1934 and was transferred to the University Campus in the 1960s. Today, Escola Politécnica is a national benchmark and considered to be the most complete faculty of engineering in Latin America.<br><br>Escola Politécnica occupies around 141,500 m<sup>2</sup> in nine buildings on the University Campus in São Paulo. 457 professors, 478 members of staff, 4,500 undergraduate students and 2,500 graduate students either work or study at the school (2012). It is divided into 15 departments involved in teaching, research and community services.<br><br>17 graduate courses are available. 15 of these courses - Environmental Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering (focusing on Computing, Automation and Control, Energy and Automation, Telecommunications or Electronic Systems), Materials Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Mining Engineering, Naval Engineering, Petroleum Engineering, and Industrial Engineering - are six-monthly, and the remaining 2 - Computing Engineering and Chemical Engineering - are different from the others: these courses are scheduled in quarterly periods and held in partnership with companies.<br><br>Escola Politécnica also offers ten Master's courses, nine PhD courses and one professional Master's course. Around 7,000 Master's and PhD degrees were awarded between 1970 and 2006. 235 Master's and 125 PhD degrees were awarded in 2012, placing the school among the biggest graduate institutions in the country and the biggest in the field of engineering.<br><br>Escola Politécnica has cooperation programs with dozens of foreign research and education institutions, amongst them France, Italy, Germany, Korea, Spain and USA institutions, which enable its students to make international exchange. Escola Politécnica offers three kinds of exchange programmes: Double Degree; Non-Degree Studies and Academic Internship.",

        historyText1: "The founding of Escola Politécnica and the concern in relation to doing and finding out why led to the opening of the first foundry geared to student's work in 1902. This foundry's cupola furnace (cubilot), a symbol of this spirit, is currently displayed in the entrance hall to the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. This concern, geared to the experimental bases of teaching, stems from the engineering schools of Germany, Switzerland and the USA. The foundry was opened by the founder of the Polytechnic School, Antônio Francisco de Paula Souza.<br><br>Metallurgical engineering began to be taught at Escola Politécnica in 1939. The original undergraduate course encompassed the area of mining engineering and had a duration of six years. In 1955, Metallurgical engineering and Mining engineering were split into two independent five-year courses. Therefore, it was from Europe and the USA that the department adopted the concept of long-term professional teaching of engineering, featuring, in addition to basic and engineering sciences, engineering projects and practices, as well as socio-economic sciences, taught in an applied perspective.<br><br>The Metallurgical Engineering Graduate Program was implemented in 1969 at Masters and PhD levels. In 1972, the department became the first in the field of engineering to be accredited by the Federal Education Council.<br><br>As from the late 1980s, the faculty, made up largely of part-time professors, began to gradually comprise full-time teaching and research professors with modern scientific academic qualifications. In 1990, the scope of the graduate program was expanded to graduate in metallurgical and materials engineering, and in 1995 the materials engineering graduation course was introduced, with the aim of accompanying the revolution taking place in the field of materials."

Many of the professors are in charge of laboratories, which encompass active engineering research groups.<br/><br/> The metallurgical engineering and materials engineering undergraduate courses are five years long. Basic scientific formation in engineering sciences is achieved after two years. The 3rd year of the course begins to focus on the areas of metallurgy and materials, and both undergraduate courses share the same curriculum. In the final two years of the courses, each area follows a specific technical and technological-based curriculum aimed at producing professionals with a high analytical capacity, capable of solving problems, working in teams and possessing a spirit of leadership and innovation. PMT also offers Master's and PhD strictu-sensu graduate courses in the area of metallurgical and materials engineering.
